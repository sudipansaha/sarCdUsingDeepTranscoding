For CycleGAN implementation, we closely follow the implmentation in:
https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix

Some of parameters are set as follows:
beta1 (momentum term for Adam optimization) - 0.5
lr (Initial learning rate for Adam optimization) - 0.0002
which_model_netD - basic (see discriminator architecture in netDiscriminator file)
which_model_netG - resnet_9blocks (see generator architecture in netGenerator file)
init_type (network initialization) - normal
norm (normalization) - instance
